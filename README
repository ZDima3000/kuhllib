kuhllib/README

This repository is intended to contain yet another implementation
of the standard C++ library. This is work in progress, intended
primarily to provide an improved interface for the standard algorithms
and a fast implementation of the I/O streams and locals library.
While prototypes for most of the components planned to be implemented
exist, many of them aren't in the repository.
