# Sender/Receiver Tutorial

This directory aims to provide a tutorial on how to use and implement
sender/receiver components (see the
[`std::execution`](http://wg21.link/p2300) proposal). The examples
in the tutorial start substantially simplified compared to a full

while getting familiar with the basics. The hope is to get eventually
get to full-fledged generic components.
